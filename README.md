# Who am I
I am 21 years old inquisitive with a love of problem solving and continuous learning; I like to identify opportunities where I can improve efficiency by organising tasks to reduce effort and as a by product cost, most importantly for me time. My happy place is when I’m engrossed in work on my computer. I enjoy interacting with people and making new friendships. I forget all issues around me when I’m working, socialising and problem solving through my screen and when I find something that I love I apply myself to learning its details enthusiastically.

I find myself scouring through stack overflow, API documentation, reddit and the book 'The well grounded Rubyist' as well various youtube channels into the early hours of morning. My passion for health fitness, I am self taught learning mainly via the internet and curious questioning of any expert that could speak on the topic and im greatful for their contribution to my understanding. I have applied that same methodology to Makers Academy one of the most discerning dev boot-camps in the world, showing a philomathic interest via discussion with my cohort, my coaches, and friends in industry.  

Prior to Makers I had a secure job in a property company('Abbeylord Properties Limited'), where for the last three years, my responsibilities included marketing and letting finding new avenues to promote our accommodation service, client check in and check out of the flats and overseeing that quality control ensuring all customer servcies and utilities were maintained. What this meant was a lot of dynamic problem solving day to day, but I didn't find it to be too challenging; I was good at my job but somewhat unfulfilled. This is what led me to find a career change to one that would be even more challenging wherein I could passionately apply myself.   

## Skills
#Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. #You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
My ability to effectively communicate not only with people but conceptually as well, is valuable in life and in code as it allows me to convey information quickly to my peers. This was primarily viewable in my time at Abbeylord as I had to quickly communicate information to managers and other members of staff to ensure that our schedules ran on time and customers were satisfied. Additionally I worked 2 years part time as equestrian assistant, working with  people and animals (mainly horses) to ensure that the best possible service is provided with minimum risk to the animals involved as well as people. Both of these required me to work in team environments where I showcased myself as a natural leader and had a clear and concise way of providing information towards my teammates.
During my time at my sixth form college(Waddesdon COE) I further developed my communicative skills when I joined the Mediators. A school initiative where members of the sixth form would help younger children with learning difficulties succeed in their Education. As well as just being there as someone these kids could confide in if they felt they needed to.

Furthermore, creative writing was always a hobby of mine in school eagerly following this by creating and organising a writing club. I would week to week pen short stories and poems to share with the group, as well as provide and receive constructive criticism on others work and my own. I'm still creatively writing but now I'm creatively writing code.
