# Who am I
I am 21 years old inquisitive with a love of problem solving and continuous learning; I like to identify opportunities where I can improve efficiency by organizing tasks to reduce effort and as a by-product cost, most importantly for me time. My happy place is when I’m engrossed in work on my computer. I enjoy interacting with people and making new friendships. I forget all issues around me when I’m working, socializing and problem solving through my screen and when I find something that I love I apply myself to learning its details enthusiastically.

I find myself scouring through stack overflow, API documentation, and books into the early hours of morning. My passion is for health fitness, I am self taught learning mainly via the internet and curious questioning of any expert that could speak on the topic and im grateful for their contribution to my understanding. I have applied that same methodology to Makers Academy one of the most discerning dev boot-camps in the world, showing a philomathic interest via discussion with my cohort, my coaches, and friends in industry.  

Prior to Makers I had a secure job in a property company('Abbeylord Properties Limited' else known as 'Accommodation london'), where for the last 2 years, my responsibilities included marketing and letting finding new avenues to promote our accommodation service, client check in and check out of the flats and overseeing that quality control ensuring all customer servcies and utilities were maintained. What this meant was a lot of dynamic problem solving day to day, but I didn't find it to be too challenging; I was good at my job but somewhat unfulfilled. This is what led me to find a career change to one that would be even more challenging wherein I could passionately apply myself.   

## Skills
My ability to effectively communicate not only with people but conceptually as well, is valuable in life and in code as it allows me to convey information quickly to my peers. This was primarily viewable in my time at Abbeylord as I had to quickly communicate information to managers and other members of staff to ensure that our schedules ran on time and customers were satisfied. This skill was also viewable during my time at Makers, as I had members of my cohort and my mentee both comment on my skill in clearly conveying concepts that I understood or ways I solved a problem. My teams found this to be useful during our projects as once I identified how to solve a issue/bug we were experiencing, I was able to detail exactly how to solve it once I understood and educate my team In effort to increase code quality.
Additionally, my motivated nature plays into why I consider self learning a skill of mine. Every framework/Programming language I have listed I learned within a 2 week period. I would apply this same motivation to the working environment putting 110% into being a adaptable engineer. 
During my time at my sixth form college(Waddesdon COE) I further developed my communicative skills when I joined the Mediators. A school initiative where members of the sixth form would help younger children with learning difficulties succeed in their Education. As well as just being there as someone these kids could confide in if they felt they needed to.
Furthermore, creative writing was always a hobby of mine in school (Clifton College) eagerly following this by creating and organizing a writing club. I would week to week pen short stories and poems to share with the group, as well as provide and receive constructive criticism on others work and my own. I'm still creatively writing but now I'm creatively writing code.

Working in a team environment is something I found myself enjoying exponentially, during my time at Makers I learned the best practices to employ in my projects, such as TDD, Agile and RESTful frameworks; I also built on my understanding on how to work in a team. Building on the communication qualities I developed during my time as an marketing and lettings agent. The result of this was two projects that both groups reflected on as being a fun intelligent team to work in,
    - acebook - a facebook clone developed as a team of 4 https://acebook-404.herokuapp.com/ | https://github.com/lucianboatright/acebook-404
    - net-positive - a exercise in machine learning where we trained an A.I to play Pong https://github.com/Jakephillips55/Net-Positive-Makers 

Both of these projects were completed using pair programming and mobbing in a team enviroment.

Whilst at makers I kept a diary for the first half of the course where I noted down my learnings and musings on the course as a whole and working in that environment https://github.com/Jakephillips55/MakersDiary-

## Hobbies
Nutrition / Gym
I push myself to be the best version of myself I can be, I have been using gyms since 2016 and it has since been a huge motivator for me to constantly aim for self improvement. Not only in physicality but mentally and socially as well.

further enhancing coding skills - I am doing this by keeping up my Makers work ethic current goal is to learn a new framework every 2 weeks as well as doing Code challenges to keep my knowledge up to and above standard 
Problem solving - I love puzzles and any excuse to get my brain going I can dive into a problem and enjoy solving it
